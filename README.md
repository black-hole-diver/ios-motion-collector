![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ios&logoColor=white)

iOS application for collecting data from Apple Watch's sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer). Each session could be marked by record label for example, to mark Bear Walk session as record id = 'Bear' and Spider Climbing session as record id = 'Spider'. The result could be exported as *.csv file that contains all the sessions.

The iOS application is used to primarily to compare sensor data output with Android Motion Collector (Galaxy Watch 4) and being a substitute application to collect children data instead of `SenseKid` application. The application is one of the 3 applications used to finish Computer BSc thesis at Eötvös Loránd University, Spring semester of 2023/2024 `Machine Learning Based Real-time Movement Detection of Children`.
